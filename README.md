MUPL (Made Up Programming Language) is a toy programming language introduced by Dan Grossman in "Programming Languages" course at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang).
One of assignmnets of the course was to write an interpreter for MUPL in Racket. Language specification can be found [here](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/13wi/hw5.pdf)

MUPL-PY is an attempt to write interpreter for MUPL in Python, to polish my Python skilss and allow me to make use of knowledge I got from Coursera's "Programming Languages" and "Compilers" courses.
